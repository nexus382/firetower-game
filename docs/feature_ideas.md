# Fire Tower Survival Feature Concepts

## Core Loop Enhancements
- **Dynamic Weather Fronts**: Spawn storm cells with 3-5 min durations affecting visibility, fire spread, and scavenging risk.
- **Tower Integrity Meter**: Track structural health from 0-100%; repairing requires lumber + metal and unlocks new floors at 60/80 thresholds.
- **Roaming NPC Survivors**: Procedurally spawn allies every 2-4 days with unique perks, morale needs, and trade offers.

## Exploration & Progression
- **Fog-of-War Wilderness**: Reveal map sectors (0.5 km grid) via scouting missions unlocking rare supply caches.
- **Relic Blueprints**: Drop legendary tower mods (e.g., solar arrays, auto-turrets) with tiered crafting chains.
- **Seasonal Events**: Rotate bi-weekly events (meteor shower, toxic bloom) that alter enemy types and resource yields.

## Overland Expedition Loop
- **Prep Phase Milestones**: Gate expedition start behind tower quests requiring stockpiles (food 10-15 units, medkits 3-5, tools durability 80%+).
- **Route Planning Map**: Unlock hex-map routes (5-9 tiles per leg) with terrain tags affecting stamina drain and encounter odds.
- **Checkpoint Atlas**: Press `M` to open an 8-node trek map; each checkpoint branches into two randomized legs lasting 3-8 in-game hours.
- **Location Deck**: Shuffle Overgrown Path, Clearing, Small Stream, Thick Forest, Old Campsite, Small Cave, and Hunting Stand cards when presenting the two travel choices.
- **Daily Trek Rhythm**: Structure each travel day into morning break camp, midday event, and dusk campfire crafting with time-sliced decisions.
- **Portable Craft Station**: Assemble the roaming bench (Metal Scrap ×2, Wood ×4, Cloth Scraps ×1, Plastic Sheet ×2, Nails ×5, Rock ×2, Crafted Knife) to unlock tier-1 crafting while hiking.
- **Trail Hazards & Boons**: Roll events (ambush, weather shift, wildlife cache) with risk/reward modifiers scaling by player morale 0-100.
- **Camp Morale System**: Track party morale using shelter quality, meal variety, and story prompts; low morale triggers debuffs or disputes.

## Combat & Defense
- **Elemental Ammo Crafting**: Combine chemicals to craft incendiary, cryo, or shock rounds with 3-tier potency scaling.
- **Siege Pattern AI**: Introduce nightly boss assaults with telegraphed weak points and countermeasure crafting.
- **Trap Grid System**: Place modular traps (snare, spike, flame) with upgrade paths unlocking at player level 5/10/15.

## Economy & Live Ops
- **Daily Contract Board**: Offer rotating missions with escalating rewards and soft-currency payouts.
- **Premium Cosmetic Crates**: Sell purely visual tower skins and survivor outfits with transparent drop rates.
- **Season Pass Track**: Provide free + premium reward lanes with mission-based XP and exclusive cosmetics.

## Social & Retention
- **Asynchronous Rescue Calls**: Allow players to send/receive aid packages using friend codes and cooldown timers.
- **Weekly Leaderboards**: Rank survival days, contract score, and tower condition with tiered soft rewards.
- **Photo Mode & Share**: Enable stylized screenshots with overlays for social sharing incentives.

## Quality of Life & Accessibility
- **Guided Onboarding Flow**: Present step-based tutorials with skip toggles and tooltips locked to UI anchors.
- **Adaptive Difficulty Bands**: Monitor player survival time and adjust spawn intensity +/-20% dynamically.
- **Customization Presets**: Save/load control + HUD layouts, colorblind palettes, and vibration strengths (0-100).

## Task Additions
- **Travel to Next Location**: Expedition leg action consuming 3-8 hours, 15% energy, and 600 calories while locking in a chosen checkpoint route and refreshing morale rolls per travel day.

## Crafting Additions
- **Portable Craft Station Recipe**: 1.5 hour build taxing 17.5% energy, consumes Metal Scrap ×2, Wood ×4, Cloth Scraps ×1, Plastic Sheet ×2, Nails ×5, Rock ×2, and a Crafted Knife to seed roaming craft access.
