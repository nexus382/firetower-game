# Fire Tower Survival - Godot Version

## Game Successfully Converted to Godot!

This is the Godot 4.2 version of Fire Tower Survival, converted from the original pygame prototype.

### ✅ What's Working

**Core Systems:**
- ✅ Army time system (24-hour clock, 6 AM start)
- ✅ Body weight & calorie tracking
- ✅ Survival stats (health, hunger, thirst, warmth, fatigue)
- ✅ Inventory system
- ✅ Weather system
- ✅ Location switching (inside/outside tower)
- ✅ Player movement with collision
- ✅ Interactive ladder system
- ✅ Basic foraging action

**UI:**
- ✅ Real-time HUD with all stats
- ✅ Digital army time display
- ✅ Body weight and calorie tracking
- ✅ Location indicators
- ✅ Action menu (basic version)

### 🎮 Controls

- **WASD** - Move player
- **E** - Interact with objects (ladders)
- **TAB** - Action menu (eat, sleep, forage)
- **ESC** - Pause

### 🏗️ How to Run

1. **Install Godot 4.2+**
2. **Open this project** in Godot
3. **Run the main scene** (`scenes/Main.tscn`)

### 📱 Mobile Ready

The project is already configured for:
- Android export
- Touch-friendly UI scaling
- Mobile-optimized renderer

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Implement eating/sleep menus** - Currently basic placeholders
2. **Add proper sprites** - Replace colored rectangles with pixel art
3. **Enhanced tower layout** - Better rooms and collision walls
4. **More interactive objects** - Scavenging, crafting, etc.
5. **Zombie threat system** - The main survival challenge

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

Godot provides much better:
- **Scene organization** - Each system is cleanly separated
- **Signal system** - Better event handling than pygame
- **Built-in UI** - Professional progress bars, panels, etc.
- **Mobile deployment** - Export to Android/iOS easily
- **Performance** - Much better frame rates
- **Sprite/Animation system** - When we add art assets

### 🎨 Art Assets Needed

To make it look like a "nice mobile game":
- Player sprite + walking animation
- Tower interior/exterior tilesets
- Item icons for inventory
- UI themes and backgrounds
- Weather effects (rain, etc.)

The game logic is solid - now it just needs polish!
